# cprd_tutorial

This is a test repo for Github page to later post my tutorial on CPRD Aurum/GOLD with SAS and R

For now, I am doing this using the old fashon file with rmarkdown (Rmd) to build, the result can be visited via

https://owenqiz.github.io/cprd_tutorial/

Apart from updating the content in my future work, I may also try to re-do this using the Quatro method, for now Quatro does NOT handle well the syntax of SAS, I will start with Rmd.
